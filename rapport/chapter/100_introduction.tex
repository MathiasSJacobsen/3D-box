\chapter{Introduction}

This report is part of my INF319 project at the \gls{uib}. The goal of the project was to
understand event-based \gls{gui} programming and the limitation to such programming.
Specify dataflow constraints and understand how they connect to \gls{gui} widgets.
Understand the possibilities and limitations of constraint systems based on \gls{gui}s.
The multiway dataflow constraint system used in the development of this project is
HotDrink. Before developing this project I had no prior experience with HotDrink.
