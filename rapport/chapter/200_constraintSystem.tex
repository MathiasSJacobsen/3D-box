\chapter{Multi-way dataflow constraint system}
\label{chap:constraint-systems}

A constraint system is seen as a tuple ${\langle V, C \rangle}$, where $V$ is a set of \textit{variables} and $C$ a set of \textit{constraints}~\cite{jarvi_algorithms_2009}. Each variable in $V$ has an associated value of a given type (string, integer, boolean, object, etc.). Each constraint in $C$ is a tuple ${\langle R, r, M \rangle}$. The variables involved in the constraint is given by ${R \subseteq V}$, $r$ is some \textit{n}-ary relation among variables in $R$, where ${n = \lvert R \rvert}$. $M$ is a set of non-empty set of \textit{constraint system methods}. Executing any method $m$ in $M$ enforces the constraint by computing values for some subset og $R$, using another disjoint subset of $R$ as inputs, such that the relation $R$ is satisfied.



\section{HotDrink}
\label{sec:hotdrink}

In this project we used the multiway dataflow constraint system library 
HotDrink~\cite{HotDrink}, which is a JavaScript-based library for multiway dataflow constraint systems in \gls{gui}s. Instead of writing explicit event handlers, the programmer writes declarative specification of data dependencies, from which the library derives the GUI behavior.

This library features a \gls{dsl} for defining constraint systems.
The \gls{dsl} allows one to specify \emph{components}, \emph{constraints}, \emph{methods} 
and \emph{variables}.
In HotDrink, a component is a collection of variables and constraints that forms an independent constraint system~\cite{svartveit2021multithreaded}. 

Variables often depend on each other,
in that case it gets into a setting of multi-way dataflow.
The HotDrink \gls{dsl} is implemented JavaScript tagged template literals
\footnote{\href{https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals}{Template literals}}, 
which can be seen in Listing~\ref{HotDrinkDSL}. This lets the programmer integrate the 
library with frontend JavaScript frameworks such as 
React\footnote{\url{https://reactjs.org/}} and Svelte\footnote{\url{https://svelte.dev/}}. 

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Example of the HotDrink \gls{dsl}},label=HotDrinkDSL, language=hotdrink]
import { component } from 'hot-drink';

const comp = component`
    var f=1337, c;

    constraint c1 {
        m1(c -> f) => c * (9/5) + 32;
        m2(f -> c) => (f -32) * 5/9;
    }
`;
\end{lstlisting}

Currently there are no integrated methods in HotDrink to bind the constraint system to 
frontend frameworks. The programmer have to decide on the best way to integrate the 
HotDrink to the frontend web application of there choosing. 
Listings~\ref{HotDrinkBinding},~\ref{reactiveStatement},~\ref{onMountHotdrink} shows one 
way of binding HotDrink with Svelte.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Function for binding HotDrink and Svelte variable},label=HotDrinkBinding, language=javascript]
function setHDValue<T>(HDvariable: Variable<T>, n: T) {
    if (n !== HDvariable.value) { 
        HDvariable.set(n);
    };
};
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Using the reactive statement, in Svelte~\cite{sveltedocs}, to update HotDrink corresopnding value, and trigger HotDrink to enforce the constraint system},label=reactiveStatement, language=javascript]
$: {
    setHDValue(HotDrinkValue, frontendValue);
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Using the onMount callback, in Svelte~\cite{sveltedocs}, to update the frontend value that correspont to the same value in HotDrink, when the HotDrink value changes.},label=onMountHotdrink, language=javascript]
onMount(() => {
    HotDrinkValue.subscribeValue((value: number) => frontendValue = value);
});
\end{lstlisting}

In the current sate of the library there is no easy documentation for the library. There are two ways writing HotDrink. The developer can either access the HotDrink \gls{api} seen in listing~\ref{hotdrinkapi}, or the developer can use the HotDrink \gls{dsl} seen in listing~\ref{HotDrinkDSL}. Both with there own disadvantages. 

Currently, HotDrink does not have a dedicated tool support --- i.e. \gls{ide} --- which 
would provide \gls{dsl}-level syntax highlighting, code validation, refactoring and 
debugging. Using the \gls{api} can easily lead to errors and is not recommended. On line 9 and 10 of listing~\ref{hotdrinkapi} the developer have to specify the index of the 
input-variables and the output-variables. In the example there are only two variables 
--- \texttt{c} and \texttt{f} --- thus it is not complicated to keep track of the index 
for the variables. In lager systems, it is easy to get lost in all the variables and 
there indexes.

Using the \gls{dsl} is the most used way to write HotDrink code. This is also easier to 
understand and more compact code then the \gls{api}, as seen in the listing~\ref{HotDrinkDSL} 
and \ref{hotdrinkapi}. Her both have the same \textit{celsius to fahrenheit} example. In 
this project we used the HotDrink \gls{dsl}. The use of the tagged template literals, as 
discussed, makes the programming process error-prone. 
Finding and fixing code errors becomes a significantly difficult process. In systems 
larger then the celsius to fahrenheit, it is easy to get lost in all the constraints, 
not knowing which variables are affected by other constraints etc. This may lead to a 
non-desirable behavior in the system.
This together with the fact that the error messages from HotDrink when using 
the \gls{dsl} are not helpful to the developer. There are no way of differentiating 
between a missing semi-colon or a missing closing bracket. The error messages are 
generic error stacks. 

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Example of how to use the HotDrink \gls{api} to simulate the relationship between fahrenheit and celsius},label=hotdrinkapi, language=JavaScript]
import { Component, Method, ConstraintSpec, MaskNone } from 'hotdrink';

// create a component and emplace some variables
export const Temp = new Component("Temp");
const c = Temp.emplaceVariable("c", 1337);
const f = Temp.emplaceVariable("f");

// create a constraint spec
const toFahrenheit = new Method(2, [0], [1], [MaskNone], (c) => (c * 9 / 5 + 32));
const toCelsius = new Method(2, [1], [0], [MaskNone], (f) => (f - 32) * 5 / 9);

const graderSpec = new ConstraintSpec([toFahrenheit, toCelsius]);

// emplace a constraint built from the constraint spec
const grader = Temp.emplaceConstraint("grader", graderSpec, [c, f]);
\end{lstlisting}
