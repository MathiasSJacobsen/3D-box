\section{Current work on HotDrink}
We are currently developing tool support for HotDrink. The development tool is intended 
to be a implementation of the HotDrink \gls{dsl} as a plugin for Visual Studio Code. 
This plugin should support \gls{ide} features mentioned in section~\ref{sec:currentstate}. 
We intend to pay a special attention to implementing the debugger functionality, such as 
the dataflow in a constraint system. We also intend to look at various views and 
visualization of running constraint systems solver, such as: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item showing the current variable values in the constraint system;
    \item showing the current dataflow, with which we mean to highlight which method in the dataflow is currently being executed;
    \item showing the history of previous dataflows;
    \item showing the generation graph, to visualize the entire history of values and how certain values have been used to compute new values;
    \item showing whether the constraints are active or not.
\end{itemize}

We use the language workbench \textbf{Eclipse Xtext}~\cite{eysholdt_xtext:_2010} / 
\textbf{Langium} to implement the \gls{dsl}. From this \gls{dsl} we get syntax 
highlighted \textit{keywords}, and also autocompletion of these keywords, as seen in figure~\ref{trenger bilde}.
